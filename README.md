# minecraft-servers
A collection of [itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) Docker Compose files I have written for reference/reuse.

## Usage
Ensure you have Docker installed.

Then, clone this repository, and run `docker compose up -d` while in whichever directory corresponds to the Minecraft server you want to run.

The typical server files will be located in the `data` directory. Do not commit this directory.
